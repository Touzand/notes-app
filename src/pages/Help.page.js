        Not really. You can use just normal text to write your notes without
        problems.

        If you dont know about <b>Mark down</b> you can visit
        <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" target="_blank">
          markdownguide.org
        </a>
        to learn how the syntax is and make your notes looks better.

      <h4>- My notes will be save forever?</h4>
      <p>
        No. remember that your notes will be save on the localStorage of ur
        browser so you can save just <b>5mb</b> ... but dont worry. if you write
        some notes of 500 characters you will have to write 10.000 notes to get
        full 5mb
